# Patchwork Scientific Figures

**Patchwork Scientific Figures** is a cross-platform graphical application (developed in C++ with Qt) designed for creating high-quality, publication-ready scientific figures.  

Unlike general-purpose tools (PowerPoint, LibreOffice Impress) or programming-based workflows (R, Python), this application focuses on **reproducibility, visual consistency, optimal layout, and long-term project archiving**.  
It is especially useful in biology and related research fields, researchers are not programers and where figure preparation often relies on non-specialized software. Packages such as R cowplot or Python matplotlib packages are gold Standard for datascientist and bioinformaticians but no real UI alternative exist for clinicians and biologists.
