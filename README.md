# Patchwork Scientific Figures

**Patchwork Scientific Figures** is a cross-platform graphical application (developed in C++ with Qt) designed for creating high-quality, publication-ready scientific figures.  

Unlike general-purpose tools (PowerPoint, LibreOffice Impress) this application focuses on **reproducibility, visual consistency, optimal layout, and long-term project archiving**. 

It is especially useful in biology and related research fields. When researchers are not programers, figures conception often relies on non-specialized softwares. 

Indeed, packages such as **R cowplot or Python matplotlib**, Gold Standards for datascientists and bioinformaticians, do not have real **UI alternative for clinicians and biologists**.
